# RasPiShutdown
Python script and schematic for a Raspberry Pi shutdown button.

I wanted something to cover my specific needs: a shutdown button for the Pi that elegantly avoided the problems of a floating pin and didn't rely on a *while* statement.

I set up my Pi to use BCM GPIO 17 (do your homework on those pin numbers, folks; I can't stress that enough), with a 1k resistor to the pin and a 10k resistor to ground.
